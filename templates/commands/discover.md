## Command Purpose
**Phase 1: Business Discovery & Context** - Understand the "why" from a business perspective

## When to Use
- At the start of any legacy modernization initiative

- When stakeholders need alignment on modernization goals

## Execution Steps

### 1. Review Business Context
Read and analyze the current project context:

## Current Pain Points  
[Document existing system problems]

## Success Metrics
[Define measurable success criteria]

## Stakeholder Priorities
[List key stakeholder concerns and goals]
```

### 3. Generate Discovery Questions
Create targeted questions for stakeholders:

**For Business Leaders:**
- What are your top 3 business priorities for the next 12-18 months?
- How is the current system limiting business growth?
- What would success look like for a modernization effort?

**For Technical Teams:**
- What are the biggest pain points with the current system?
- How much time is spent on maintenance vs. new features?
- What technical constraints block business requirements?

**For End Users:**
- What workflow inefficiencies do you experience?
- How does the current system impact your productivity?
- What improvements would have the biggest impact?

### 4. Create Stakeholder Interview Plan
Generate a structured approach:
