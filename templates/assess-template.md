# Phase 2: Assess (Current System Audit)

## Goal
Understand the "what" from a technical perspective.

## Key Questions
- What does the existing system include? (code, architecture, dependencies, integrations)
- What are the technical risks and bottlenecks? (outdated frameworks, scalability, maintainability)
- How is the system performing against business needs today?

## Activities

### 1. Code Review and Architecture Analysis
**Codebase Assessment:**
- [ ] Technology stack inventory (languages, frameworks, libraries)
- [ ] Code quality metrics (complexity, test coverage, maintainability)
- [ ] Architecture patterns and design principles
- [ ] Code organization and modularity
- [ ] Technical debt hotspots

**Architecture Review:**
- [ ] System boundaries and component relationships
- [ ] Data flow and integration patterns
- [ ] Scalability and performance characteristics
- [ ] Security architecture and patterns
- [ ] Deployment and infrastructure setup

### 2. Performance, Security, and Dependency Audit
**Performance Analysis:**
- [ ] Response time and throughput metrics
- [ ] Resource utilization patterns
- [ ] Bottlenecks and performance constraints
- [ ] Scalability limitations
- [ ] Load testing results (if available)

**Security Assessment:**
- [ ] Known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- [ ] Security best practices compliance
- [ ] Authentication and authorization patterns
- [ ] Data protection and privacy measures
- [ ] Compliance with security standards

**Dependency Analysis:**
- [ ] Third-party library versions and support status
- [ ] End-of-life software components
- [ ] License compliance and risks
- [ ] Vendor lock-in considerations
- [ ] Update and patching complexity

### 3. Business Impact Mapping
**Technical Issues to Business Impact:**
- [ ] Map performance issues to business metrics
- [ ] Identify maintenance burden costs
- [ ] Document downtime and reliability issues
- [ ] Assess development velocity constraints
- [ ] Evaluate compliance and security risks

**High-Impact Areas Identification:**
- [ ] Critical business functionality modules
- [ ] High-maintenance components
- [ ] Performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Integration pain points

### Risk Assessment Matrix
**High Risk Areas:**
- [ ] Critical vulnerabilities requiring immediate attention
- [ ] End-of-life components with no support
- [ ] Performance bottlenecks blocking business growth
- [ ] Architecture constraints limiting scalability

**Medium Risk Areas:**
- [ ] Outdated but supported dependencies
- [ ] Moderate technical debt accumulation
- [ ] Performance issues with workarounds
- [ ] Limited test coverage in key areas

**Low Risk Areas:**
- [ ] Modern, well-supported technologies
- [ ] Good code quality and test coverage
- [ ] Adequate performance for current needs
- [ ] Manageable technical debt levels

## Expected Outputs

### Current State Technical Report
**Executive Summary:**
- Overall system health assessment
- Top 5 technical risks and their business impact
- Recommended priority areas for modernization

**Detailed Findings:**
- Technology stack analysis
- Architecture assessment
- Performance and scalability analysis
- Security and compliance review
- Dependency and vendor risk analysis

### Business Impact Mapping
**Technical Issues to Business Impact:**
| Technical Issue | Business Impact | Severity | Cost of Inaction |
|----------------|----------------|----------|------------------|
| Example: Slow API response | Decreased customer satisfaction | High | $X/month in lost revenue |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Modernization Priority Matrix:**
- High Impact, High Effort areas
- High Impact, Low Effort areas (quick wins)
- Low Impact, High Effort areas (avoid)
- Low Impact, Low Effort areas (nice-to-have)

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] Comprehensive code and architecture review completed
- [ ] Performance, security, and dependency audit finished
- [ ] Technical risks quantified and prioritized
- [ ] Business impact mapping documented
- [ ] Technical health scorecard completed
- [ ] Current state report reviewed and validated
